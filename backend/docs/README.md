### Setup Python Virtual Environment

Create `impulse-vi` virtual environment for this project.

```text
Notice that this project will soon become larger as it will have more than one backend service,
and each service may need a different python virtual environment to run. So the bellow configuration is set for
each specific backend module.
```

```bash
# change this to suit your env
export APPS_HOME=~/GitHub/BTI-apps-training

cd ${APPS_HOME}/backend
pyenv virtualenv 3.7.4 apps-training-env
pyenv local apps-training-env
pip install -r ${APPS_HOME}/backend/requirements.txt

```
